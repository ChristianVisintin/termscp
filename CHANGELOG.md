## 0.7.0

Released on 12/10/2021

> üçÅ Autumn update 2021 üçá

- **Aws S3** ü™£
  - Added support for the aws-s3 protocol.
  - Operate on your bucket directly from the file explorer.
  - You can also save your buckets as bookmarks.
  - Aws s3 reads credentials directly from your credentials file at `$HOME/.aws/credentials` or from environment. Read more in the user manual.
- **Auto update** ‚¨áÔ∏è
  - Possibility to update termscp directly via GUI or CLI.
  - Install update via CLI running `(sudo) termscp --update`.
  - Install update via GUI from auth form: when the "new version message" is displayed press `<CTRL+R>`, then enter `YES` in the radio input asking whether to install the update.
- **Notifications** üì´
  - termscp will now send Desktop notifications in these cases
    - on transfer completed (minimum transfer size can be specified in configuration; default 512MB)
    - on transfer error (same as above)
    - on update available
  - Added "notifications enabled" in configuration (Default enabled)
  - Added "Notifications: minimum transfer size": if transfer size is greater or equal than the specified value, notifications for transfer will be displayed.
- **Prompt user when about to replace existing file on a file transfer** ‚ùì
  - Whenever a file transfer is about to replace an existing file on local/remote host, you will be prompted if you're sure you really want to replace that file.
  - You may want to disable this option. You can go to configuration and set "Prompt when replacing existing files?" to "NO"
- **‚ùó BREAKING CHANGES ‚ùó**:
  - Added a new key in themes: `misc_info_dialog`: if your theme won't load, just reload it. If you're using a customised theme, you can add to it the missing key via a text editor. Just edit the `theme.toml` in your `$CONFIG_DIR/termscp/theme.toml` and add `misc_info_dialog` (Read more in manual at Themes).

## 0.3.1

Released on 18/01/2021

- **Keyring to store secrets**
  - On both MacOS and Windows, the secret used to encrypt passwords in bookmarks it is now store in the OS secret vault. This provides much more security to store the password

  - Added connection timeout to 30 seconds to SFTP/SCP clients and improved name lookup system.
- Bugfix:
  - Solved index in explorer files list which was no more kept after 0.3.0

- Breaking changes: on **MacOS / Windows systems only**, the password you saved for bookmarks won't be working anymore if you have support for the keyring crate. Because of the migration to keyring, the previously used secret hasn't been migrated to the storage, instead a new secret will be used. To solve this, just save the bookmark again with the password.
