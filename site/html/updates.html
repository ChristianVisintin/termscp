          Termscp is an application that is still in its early stage of
          development, the first version has been released in december in 2020
          and practically there's only one
          <a href="https://termscp.veeso.dev/" target="_blank">guy</a> working on
          it and there's still a lot of work to do in order to improve it and
          make it fast and reliable. Along to this, you should also consider
          that since it's an application which works with network protocols and
          is intended to manipulate secrets and credentials there may always be
          a security issue. I can't guarantee there's no security issues in the
          versions I've released in these months, and if there are they might
          not be even my fault, but they might be contained in the libraries
          termscp relies on. Because of this, it's always VERY important to keep
          termscp up to date. To prove how much I care about it, just consider
          that I've implemented something that many other open source
          applications won't do: the update check. Whenever you start termscp
          (unless if deactivated in configuration) termscp will always check if
          there's a new version available and will notify you immediately. In
          addition to security concerns, each major update will bring many
          awesome features ðŸ¦„ you can't miss and the application is getting more
          reliable and stable after each update ðŸ˜„

          The GUI method just consists in starting termscp with no options, you
          then should be in front of the authentication form. If there's an
          update available a message like "termscp x.y.z is OUT! Update and read
          release notes with CTRL+R". All you have to do at this point to update
          termscp, is:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal px-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li translate="updates.gui.steps.st">press CTRL+R. The release notes should now be displayed.</li>
          <li translate="updates.gui.steps.nd">Select "YES" in the "Install update?" radio input</li>
          <li translate="updates.gui.steps.rd">Press "ENTER"</li>
        </ol>
        <p translate="updates.gui.then" class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          If everything worked correctly a green message "termscp x.y.z has been
          installed!" will be displayed. Just restart termscp and enjoy the
          update ðŸ˜„

          If you prefer, you can install a new update just using the dedicated

          Once started, you will be prompted whether to install or not the
          update. Confirm the installation and ta-dah, the new version of
          termscp should now be available on your machine
